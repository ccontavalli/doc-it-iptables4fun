<!-- Why the tracking code? There are many good reasons to have
     analytics on something you published and spent time on:

       1) You can see what people are most interested in (eg, how they ended
          up on your document - what they were searching for, ...).
          Which in turn helps me decide how much time to spend on this
          document, how to improve it, and what to focus on.

       2) It's good to motivate my work - I would not work on a document
          if it was not useful to someone. I generally know what I write
          about :). 
     
     If this offends or bothers you, please let me know - and do feel free
     to remove this snippet if you decide to publish the document on your
     own side. I am also looking for suggestions on creating a good feedback
     mechanism with users.
